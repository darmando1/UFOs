# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The objective of this project is to create an interactive website that allows users to view data on potential UFO sightings. The website also allows for users to utilize Date, City, State, Country and Shape filters to sift through the data. The user is capable of utilizing one or more filters simultaneously.
## Results
Using the "Filter Search" portion of the website the user can input one or more filters to achieve a desired result. For example, sifting through the data the user sees that the state of California ("ca") appears multiple times. Using the "state" filter the user can identify all possible UFO sightings in ca as shown below.

As shown, the results are filtered to include only potential sightings in California. This is only one singular filter. The user can further filter the information by including a City. The user sees that "el cajon" appears a few times. The user may choose to filter on el cajon as shown below.

As shown, the user can continue to utilize more and more filters to achieve a desired result.
## Summary - Drawbacks
Although the filter allows the user to utilize multiple filters, the user CANNOT utilize two of the same filter. For example, the user cannot see sightings in BOTH California and Arizona.
## Summary Cont - Recommendations
The staff makes two recommendations:
 
  - The website be updated to include the ability to filter by multiple Dates, Cities, States, Countries and Shapes.
  - In the interest of scalability, as more data is included an "export" function would be extremely useful.
